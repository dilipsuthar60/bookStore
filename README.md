Certainly! Here's a README template for your Node.js RESTful API project for managing books using MongoDB as the database:

# Book Management API

This is a RESTful API built with Node.js and MongoDB for managing books.

## Features

- **CRUD Operations**: Users can perform the following CRUD operations on books:

  - Add a new book (title, author, summary)
  - View a list of all books
  - View details of a specific book by its ID
  - Update a book's details
  - Delete a book

- **Database**: MongoDB is used to store book data. You can set up your MongoDB database, whether it's a cloud solution like MongoDB Atlas or a local server or virtual machine.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the project, you need to have the following installed:

- Node.js: [Download and Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- MongoDB: [Download and Install MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash git clone
   https://github.com/dilipsuthar60/bookStore.git
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the project root directory and set the MongoDB connection string. You can use MongoDB Atlas or your local MongoDB instance. Here's an example `.env` file:

   ```env
   MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   ```

4. Start the server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

The server will run on `http://localhost:5000` by default.

## API Endpoints

- **GET /books**: Get a list of all books.

- **GET /books/:id**: Get details of a specific book by its ID.

- **POST /books**: Add a new book. Send a JSON request with title, author, and summary.

- **PUT /books/:id**: Update a book's details by its ID. Send a JSON request with the updated data.

- **DELETE /books/:id**: Delete a book by its ID.
